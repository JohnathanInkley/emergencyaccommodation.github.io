Dear Andrew Tonkin,

I am a member of London Renter's Union. Our member Muzibul is scheduled to be evicted from his home by bailiffs on Monday 4th August, in less than one weeks' time!

Muzibul has a case worker within Newham Borough Council Housing Office, but he has not yet been given an offer of a specific property, and time is running out.

Muzibul needs to be given a specific property to move to before he is evicted. He has a serious health condition, has five small children and is the carer of his mother in law who resides with them. 

His health condition, including recent surgery and risk of hernia means that Muzibul cannot lift and carry his house contents. Furthermore, he has an urgent NHS appointment on Monday 4th August, meaning he must move with his family before Monday or seriously risk his health. 

I am writing to you today in support of our member and to ask that you intervene immediately in this case to offer Muzibul:

  1. A specific property which his family can move into before the scheduled eviction.
  2. A property in the Borough of Newham.
  3. Temporary storage and transportation of his house contents under chapter 20 of the Homelessness Code of Guidance for Local Authorities.

At London Renter's Union we support each other and we don't give up!

Please instruct your Housing Officers immediately and email Muzibul by end of Wednesday to inform him CCing newham-leytonstone@londonrentersunion.org.uk. If we do not hear from you, we will be forced to take further action.

Yours sincerely,
