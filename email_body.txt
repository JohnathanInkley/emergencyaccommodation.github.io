Dear Ahsan Khan,

I am a member of the London Renters Union, writing to you regarding my fellow members Julieta Mendez and Rene Cervandez. They are an elderly couple (Julieta is 67 and Rene is 68) who will be made street homeless in mere hours on the morning of Tuesday 27th May at 11AM without your intervention. 

Rene and Julieta were evicted and harassed by their landlord last week and were put in emergency accommodation on Friday. Waltham Forest Council has put them in contact with a local homelessness charity, but given the bank holiday weekend Rene and Julieta have not heard from the charity. Instead, they have been told they must leave their accommodation on Tuesday 27th May at 11am.

Rene and Julieta are both vulnerable due to their age and also several health issues that will be exacerbated by being evicted again. Rene has missed work due to the ongoing situation and his employment is at risk. They have experienced so much instability over the past few weeks and it has placed a lot of pressure on both of their mental and physical health. I amongst many others call you to act to extend their stay at the accommodation until they have had enough time to speak to the Single Homelessness Project and prepare their next steps.

Yours sincerely,
