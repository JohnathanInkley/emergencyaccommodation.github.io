Dear Mr. Moseley,

I'm writing to you in support of the London Renters Union's campaign in support of Mr. Ramburn and his family, as well as other disabled L&Q renters.

The London Renters Union is requesting a meeting to talk to you about L&Q's treatment of disabled tenants like Mr. Ramburn. The LRU represents over seven thousand tenants across London, including hundreds of L&Q tenants. Will you meet with them to work together towards a solution to Mr. Ramburn's case and an improvement of L&Q's treatment of disabled tenants?

Kind regards,
