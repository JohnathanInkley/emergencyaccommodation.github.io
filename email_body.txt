Dear Andrew Goodman,

I hope this email finds you well. I am a member of the London Renters Union, a group of over 7000 people across London who support each other with housing problems through legal action, media work and protest.

The reason I am writing to you is that one of our members, Iris Manuela Dos Anjos Cabral of 34 King Court E10 5AJ, was told unofficially by you that she was going to be rehoused. However it has been three months and she still hasn’t received her official letter.

I am therefore asking you to send her that letter immediately.

Many thanks,
