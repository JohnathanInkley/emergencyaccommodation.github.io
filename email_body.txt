Dear Nicole Sharp and Sharon Jones,

I am a member of the London Renters Union, writing to you regarding my fellow member Geraldine Taiwo who lives in one of your properties. 

As you are aware, Geraldine and her two children have been living in unsafe housing for over 6 months. 

The issues are as follows:
	- There is a severe mouse infestation in the entire property. These mice have destroyed much of our member’s furniture and clothes.
	- There are rats in the property’s loft - this is a category 2 hazard under the Housing Act 2004 and action must be taken immediately on the issue.
	- There has been a severe maggot infestation resulting from the death of a number of these rats.
	- There is widespread disrepair and mould in the property.

These issues have been raised with Sovereign Network Group a large number of times. A pest control officer appointed by you has visited the property many times and has stated the property is not habitable. Yet you have taken no action to re-house our member and her family. The pest situation is so severe our member and her family have become traumatised by the pests and are having to live in a single room in the property. Your own complaints team has issued inadequate responses a number of times too.

None of this is acceptable. We were forced to come to SNG's offices to make sure Geraldine is heard and her housing issues resolved. Neither yourselves nor your colleagues would speak with Geraldine. We therefore request that you agree to a meeting with Geraldine and her London Renters Union representatives by end of day, Monday 28th April, to discuss a resolution to her housing issues. We do not wish to take further action, but if a meeting is not agreed we will be forced to take further and more extensive action.  

Yours sincerely,
