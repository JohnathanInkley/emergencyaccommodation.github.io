Dear Ahsan Khan,

I am PLACEHOLDER_1, writing to you regarding PLACEHOLDER_2 Abida Hussein. 

Abida and her family of three children went through a terrible experience of being evicted from their home in September. However, Waltham Forest Councilâ€™s housing team have made a bad situation worse through a series of failings. Abida was evicted unexpectedly from her emergency accommodation in Enfield on 22nd October, and was temporarily street homeless again until the London Renters Union alerted you to her situation. 

Since then, Abida has experienced a lot of anxiety around how long she will remain in her current accommodation with no clarity provided by the council. Instead, on 20th November she was told that the Housing Team had failed to refer her case to the Temporary Accommodation Booking team, delaying her stay in the hotel further.

Renters deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, not forgotten about and ignored. The law says that families should not be forced to stay in a hotel for more than six weeks due to the effect of cramped conditions on the physical and mental health of children and their parents. Abida and her children should be able to celebrate Christmas in a suitable home that provides privacy, safety and stability.

I amongst many others demand that you urgently prioritise finding Abida a place to live that is not a hotel before the 25th December. If we are not listened to, we will find way to make even more public the mistreatment of your residents and the failures of your team. If Abida does not have certainty by 13th December we will take further action.

Yours sincerely,
