Dear Kulbir Channa and Zulfiqar Mulak,

I am a member of the London Renters Union, an organisation of over 7000 renters across London supporting each other through advocacy, legal action, media and protest.

I’m getting in touch because I’m concerned about my fellow member Mr. Shahin Khandaker, who has been living in very overcrowded accommodation for more than 17 months. His children are struggling to study, as they have no place to do it. They have no privacy and are very upset about the conditions they live under. The family’s entire life is deeply affected by this issue. 

I am glad that Newham council has agreed to move this family to more suitable accommodation, but I am concerned that the transfer is taking weeks and weeks. Every day that the family spends in unsuitable accommodation affects the health and wellbeing of the children and parents. I am writing to urge you to speed up the transfer, so that the family can finally live in the peace they deserve.

When will the transfer happen?

Thank you! 
Kind regards,
